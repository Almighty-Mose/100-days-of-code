# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Date Planner quiz, figuring out radio button components

**Thoughts:** I've hard coded in the buttons, but I'd really like them to be generated iteratively to be more DRY. The form is getting there though, made some good progress!

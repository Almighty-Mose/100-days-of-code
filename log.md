# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Date Planner quiz, figuring out radio button components

**Thoughts:** I've hard coded in the buttons, but I'd really like them to be generated iteratively to be more DRY. The form is getting there though, made some good progress!

### Day 2: May 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got the Radio buttons working the way I want!

**Thoughts**: Today was a big day for me. I managed to get the radio buttons abstract and dynamically generated instead of just hard coding them in, WITHOUT LOOKING ANYTHING UP. Big day!
